# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

This repository contains a structured breakdown of the **Requirement Analysis** phase within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It is part of the ALX ProDev Frontend program and simulates a real-world software planning scenario for a **Booking Management System**.

The purpose of this repository is to document, analyze, and visualize the system requirements to lay a solid foundation for future development. By completing this project, I will apply industry-standard practices and improve my ability to define and communicate functional needs clearly.
